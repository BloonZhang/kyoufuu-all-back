# Kyoufuu All Back

## Solo Coursework Project

Kyoufuu All Back is a one-button rhythm game developed entirely in Easy68k Assembly, inspired by a silly [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DVTLvOupE&t=70s). Press the space bar to chop cabbages to the beat of the music, but be careful! Miss a cabbage and your combo will drop back to 0.
